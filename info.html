                <h1 id="animal-info">How To Take Care Of My Dog:</h1>
                <h4 id="animal-info">Make sure your dog is well fed and always has water, but make sure you dont overfeed them as that can cause health problems. dogs are very active animals
                    so make sure to walk them outside and play with them often, as that is how you build a bond with them, regular checkups at the vet are 
                    always good ideas, make sure to pet your dog, especially on the nose since that forms a deeper bond between both the humand and the animal.

                <h1 id="animal-info">How To Take Care Of My Cat:</h1>
                <h4 id="animal-info">Make sure your cat is well fed and always has water, similar to dogs it is also important not to overfeed them as that can also cause health problems for them
                    its best to keep your cat indoors as outdoor cats have been know to be negative for the environment, that said theres nothing wrong with training your cat on a leash
                    as long as they are happy and comfortable with that. cats need lots of attention, so although it may hard to take them outside, or not an option if they dont like it,
                    make sure to play with them as much as possible, buy interactive toys just for them, and toys taht you control like fishing rod toys, so you can actively play with 
                    your cat, so that they can be as happy as possible.
